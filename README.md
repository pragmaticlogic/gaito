The whole thing uses Ionic as a mobile app framework and Socket.io for sending the data. You should consider it more as an interactive sketch or proof of concept, rather than a working prototype.

## Running the app

You need [Node](https://nodejs.org), NPM and [Ionic](http://ionicframework.com/getting-started/). Then do

```
npm install
ionic serve
```

Alternatively, for the native experience you can download the Ionic View app (iOS) and download the app by entering the id `E4E64D52`.
